	- reimplement diagonal movement
	- create a data structure to hold SDL_Surface + animations (should be separate from game data, but may depend on game data)
	- create a sprite sheet that has animations for all basic actions (walking, rolling, attacking, blocking, charging)
	- add character stats to the sprite struct

	# this is important but not urgent
	- completely separate game data from SDL rendering structures, make game data independent of input/output mechanisms
		- create an abstarct interface for game state interaction (input)
		- create a smart, abstract interface for retreiving game state information (output)
