1.
	- create a chipmunk cpSpace and put an object in it.
	- combine a chipmunk object to a display object (need to be able to see the objects)
	- bind keys to move the object around
	- create a second object to test collisions (dynamic)

2.
	- create a data structure for full game state (used for saving/loading games)
	- create a game state file format and a parser for it
	- create methods for saving and loading game state

3.
	- decide how maps are going to work( tiles/chunks? )
	- implement a map to test the design
	- add maps to the game state spec (including loading and storing)
