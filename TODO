in order of importance:

	- decide how effects with durations will be handled
	- create a field (sensor shape) which applies a force or velocity to the sprite body;
	- create a sprite sheet that has animations for all basic actions (walking, rolling, attacking, blocking, charging)
	- add character stats to the sprite struct
	- create a map data structure
	- create config files for various data structures
	- create routines to read and write the config files into their corresponding data structures
	- add support for screen resize & choose an effective view port size rather than using the screen size

# this would be nice, but is not necessary:
	- completely separate game data from SDL rendering structures, make game data independent of input/output mechanisms (with clean interfaces)
