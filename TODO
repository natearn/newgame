	- implement incremental physics update and remove timer
	- create a data structure for full game state (used for saving/loading games)
		- serialize with YAML!
		- create methods for saving and loading game state
	- create a map data structure
		- implement a map to test the design
		- add maps to the game state spec (including loading and storing)
	- implement variable frame rate by adjusting timer interval in the redraw handler
	! this is an optimization
	- Reorganize sprites and animations (yet again)
		- There will be many animations that depend on a single surface
		- There will be many sprites/entities that look the same (use the same surface and animations)
		- need to separate the definition of an animation from an instance of one
		* why not let bodies have sprites instead of sprites having bodies?
