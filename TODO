	- combine SDL_Surfaces with animations and create a simple API for controlling it ("finalize" sprite design)

	- look into collision handling (callbacks)

	- create a data structure for full game state (used for saving/loading games)
	- create a game state file format and a parser for it
	- create methods for saving and loading game state

	- create an abstraction layer around keyboard inputs so that I can later add configurable key mappings
		actions(15):
			- move up/down/left/right
			- strike
			- charge
			- dodge
			- block
			- skill 1/2/3/4
			- menu
			- cancel

	- implement a map to test the design
	- add maps to the game state spec (including loading and storing)
