in no particular order:

	- make sprites more generic
	- decide how effects with durations will be handled
	- create a field (sensor shape) which applies a force or velocity to the sprite body;
	- create a sprite sheet that has animations for all basic actions (walking, rolling, attacking, blocking, charging)
	- add character stats to the sprite struct
	- create a map data structure
	- create config files for various data structures
	- create routines to read and write the config files into their corresponding data structures
	- add support for screen resize & choose an effective view port size rather than using the screen size
	- make game data independent of input/output mechanisms

tree realisations:
	- some sprites will use the space static body
	- the position of the frame on the body will need to be fine-tuned for every sprite
	- everyone seems to have a different opinion on what color to use for sprite sheet backgrounds
	- still need to sort sprites by y-posn for drawing
