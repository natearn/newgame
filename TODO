	- implement incremental physics update and remove timer
	- implement variable frame rate by adjusting timer interval in the redraw handler
	- create a data structure for full game state (used for saving/loading games)
		- all shared data is kept in this structure
		- add keyboard controls to game state through a callback function (HandleInputEvent(gamestate,event))
		- serialize with YAML!
		- create methods for saving and loading game state
	- create an abstraction layer around keyboard inputs so that I can later add configurable key mappings
		actions(15):
			- move up/down/left/right
			- strike
			- charge
			- dodge
			- block
			- skill 1/2/3/4
			- menu
			- cancel
	- create a map data structure
		- implement a map to test the design
		- add maps to the game state spec (including loading and storing)
	! this is an optimization
	- Reorganize sprites and animations (yet again)
		- There will be many animations that depend on a single surface
		- There will be many sprites/entities that look the same (use the same surface and animations)
		- need to separate the definition of an animation from an instance of one
		* why not let bodies have sprites instead of sprites having bodies?
